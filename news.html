                    <p class="card-text">After launching at the James Whitner-led shop’s in-store and online outposts on November 24th, the A Ma Maniére x Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG “Airness” is scheduled to release globally on December 3rd. Effectively a love letter to the Black community, as well as a token of a long-term commitment between all parties involved to fight for more opportunities for Black and brown folks, the high-top retro is clad in “Sail” and “Burgundy Crush” colors. Beyond simply following the first Air Jordan‘s standard design blueprint, Whitner and team have covered the sneaker in a textured, crack leather, as well as handful of other luxurious materials. Akin to the brand’s Air Jordan 3 collaboration from June, the upcoming sneakers feature a quilted inner lining, “aged” midsole and hidden reminders from the boutique to the wearer. The Houston, Washington D.C. and Atlanta-located shop stamps its name on the tongue label, and its logo appears on the included hang tag. Together, each component of the latest Jordan 1 further proves that Whitner and The Whitaker Group are doing things in their own way, and connecting with people along the way. Enjoy more detailed shots of the pair here below, and find A Ma Maniére’s latest collaboration arriving to Nike SNKRS on December 3rd.

                    <p class="card-text">The trajectory of Derrick Rose’s career changed permanently on the night of April 28th, 2012 when the Bulls star guard tore his ACL on what appeared to be a rather standard movement considering his style of play. It’s tough to swallow the fact that things were all good not even a year prior as the Memphis standout was awarded the NBA MVP in the 2010-2011 season. It appeared as if Chi-Town would be re-living the glory days of the Jordan-led dynasty of the 1990s as they eclipsed the Magic, Cavs, and Celtics as the top Finals contender coming out of the East. Derrick Rose will undoubtedly be among the biggest “what if” stories in sports history, but the oft-injured guard has found new purpose in the NBA, but not as a perennial MVP candidate. Rose has emerged as a pivotal floor general for Tom Thibodeau, a mentor to young backcourt players, and an empath on social media. Throughout the journey, Rose has managed to maintain his relevance and following simply for his humanity. With a lifetime deal in operation, adidas has continued to release Derrick Rose’s footwear, and now’s about the time that the retro lifecycle begins. Ten years ago, during Rose’s MVP season, adidas released the D Rose 1 and the D Rose 1.5 – the latter serving as a lightweight, postseason-ready issue of the signature model. It debuted in this sleek Bulls-ready colorway with black suede uppers, white patent leather toes, and a tech-filled construction that allowed Rose to play at the speeds he’s most comfortable with. Currently, retailers have marked down December 15th as the official release date of the adidas D Rose 1.5 retro, but there’s no telling if these will be delayed just like most other launch product. Stay tuned for updates and we’ll fill you in as we learn more.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Teased via Instagram in mid-November, SNS has finally officially unveiled its latest New Balance 574 collaboration. Inspired by the beauty of raw nature, the silhouette couples tried-and-proven pigskin nubuck, soft synthetic leather and nylon lining with a predominantly green and violet color palette. Hairy suede enters the mix around the forefoot and heel, leaving perhaps its most notable impression on the profile “N” logos. While not a proposition from a high-end brand like Casablanca, Sneakernstuff’s next joint-effort with New Balance delivers a luxurious take through concept. To further submerge its nature-inspired 574 into the theme, the retailer has tapped New York-based illustrator, Elijah Anderson, for a poster campaign that blends his signature style with SNS and NB’s vision. Furthermore, nature-inspired activations will soon take place at the retailer’s New York City and Tokyo locations. Enjoy the first official poster for SNS’ 574 (which takes elements from old NB ads) here below, and find pairs arriving exclusively to the SNS app via a raffle that closes on Friday, December 10th. In other sneaker news, the Air Jordan 11 “Cool Grey” returns for the whole family on December 11th.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">There’s no stopping Ye – the being formerly known as “Kanye West.” Whether in music or fashion, the 44-year-old has consistently proven that he will be the “last man standing.” On the adidas YEEZY front, the “DONDA”-artist continues to cement his legacy through propositions like the YEEZY FOAM RUNNER “MX Sand Grey” set to release on December 11th. First seen on the former-Mr. West’s son, Saint, the upcoming drop features a light brown base contrasted by a mix of grey, dark brown and pink streaks. The earliest look at the YEEZYs revealed a much darker arrangement, but official images of the “MX Sand Grey” release suggest final products have been modified to resemble the prevailing color scheme of Ye’s adidas-backed venture. Nevertheless, the eye-catching reddish tone that joins the aforementioned hues appears throughout the toe tip, medial side and outsole, further diversifying the FOAM RUNNER‘s design roster. Product shots of kid and toddler sizes haven’t emerged, but that’s likely to change soon. Enjoy official images of the pair here below, and anticipate a launch on December 11th.
